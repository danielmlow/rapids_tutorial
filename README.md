# rapids_tutorial
RAPIDS creates libraries that implement commonly used Python packages to work GPUs. Some RAPIDS projects include cuDF, a pandas-like dataframe manipulation library; cuML, a collection of machine learning libraries that will provide GPU versions of algorithms available in scikit-learn; cuGraph, a NetworkX-like accelerated graph analytics library.
